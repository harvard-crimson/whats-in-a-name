 “When the president talks about having a true story or a true dialogue about Harvard and its complicity when it comes to slavery, we have to have a real open discussion, and right here at the Peabody Museum are images that kind of epitomize this whole issue of the exploitation of slaves and you can’t really have an honest discussion without first addressing that. So I am hoping if she is true to what she is saying, she’ll address that.”
